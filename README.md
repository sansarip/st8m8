# St8M8

I've abandoned this little pet project 😥

The main reason being that I found little use for it as I got more acclimated to looking at and understanding Clojure code. It was a - at the time - neat idea that I sprouted when I was first learning Clojure and using map representations of FSMs I was using on the front-end. But, as I gained more expertise, the visualizations just kinda happened organically in my head 🧠.

That being said, the plugin does work to visualize Clojure FSMs, but I have not put it in the IntelliJ plugin marketplace. One _can_ build it manually with gradle and import it into IntelliJ themself 🤷‍♂️
